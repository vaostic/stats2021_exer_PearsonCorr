## Package management in R

``` r
# keep a list of the packages used in this script
packages <- c("tidyverse","rio","jmv")
```

This next code block has eval=FALSE because you don’t want to run it
when knitting the file. Installing packages when knitting an R notebook
can be problematic.

``` r
# check each of the packages in the list and install them if they're not installed already
for (i in packages){
  if(! i %in% installed.packages()){
    install.packages(i,dependencies = TRUE)
  }
  # show each package that is checked
  print(i)
}
```

``` r
# load each package into memory so it can be used in the script
for (i in packages){
  library(i,character.only=TRUE)
  # show each package that is loaded
  print(i)
}
```

A note about working with packages and functions in R: When installing
packages you may see notifications that SomePackage::function() masks
OtherPackage::function(). What that means is that two different packages
used the same function name. The functions may or may not do the same
thing, but for whatever reason the pogrammers of each package happened
to choose the same name for a function in their respective package. The
last package installed will be the version of that function that will be
used if only the function name is used in your R code. The
SomePackage::function() notation with the colons in it means to use the
function named function() from the package named SomePackage. I think I
have decided when I write R code that I will always try to stick to that
notation. That way it’s very clear which package a desired function
comes from and there will be no problems with masking if different
packages used the same function name.

## Open the dataset

The rio package works for importing several different types of data
files. We’re going to use it in this class. There are other packages
which can be used to open datasets in R. You can see several options by
clicking on the Import Dataset menu under the Environment tab in
RStudio. (For a csv file like we have this week we’d use either From
Text(base) or From Text (readr). Try it out to see the menu dialog.)

``` r
# import the Week1.csv dataset into RStudio

# Using the file.choose() command allows you to select a file to import from another folder.
# dataset <- rio::import(file.choose())

# This command will allow us to import the csv file included in our project folder.
data <- rio::import("Exam Anxiety.sav")
```

# Correlation

## Create a scatterplot matrix

I couldn’t see how to create a scatterplot matrix in Jamovi right away
so I found some R functions. The code is below.

``` r
# The pairs and plots functions are part of baseR

# pairs using column numbers
pairs(data[,2:4], pch = 19)
```

``` r
# pairs using formula format
pairs(~Revise + Exam + Anxiety, data=data, pch = 19)

# Plot
plot(data[ , 2:4] , pch=20 , cex=1.5 , col="#69b3a2")
```

``` r
# the ggpairs function is part of GGally package which expands ggplot2 package

library(ggplot2)
library(GGally)
```

    ## Registered S3 method overwritten by 'GGally':
    ##   method from   
    ##   +.gg   ggplot2

``` r
# ggpairs using column numbers
GGally::ggpairs(data,columns=2:4)
```

``` r
# ggpairs using column names
GGally::ggpairs(data,columns=c('Revise','Exam','Anxiety'),lower = list(continuous = "smooth"))
```
